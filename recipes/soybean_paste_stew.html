        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Doenjang jjigae is a staple Korean stew that uses fermented Korean soybean paste to create a deeply flavorful broth accentuated with tofu and fresh vegetables. With the help of my step-by-step photos, preparing this stew at home becomes effortless.        </p>
        <p>Doenjang jjigae is a beloved Korean stew made with soybean paste, often considered the ultimate comfort food alongside kimchi jjigae and sundubu jjigae. Korean restaurants typically serve it as the final course after a meal of Korean pork belly barbecue (samgyupsal), bulgogi, or galbi. The aroma of this authentic Korean stew evokes nostalgia for many Koreans, including myself.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>FOR THE SSAMJANG (KOREAN DIPPING SAUCE)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for ssamjang and stir until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Then, transfer the mixture into individual sauce bowls for serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>FOR THE GREEN ONION SALAD</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the green onion with the remaining ingredients and toss together using kitchen tongs. </li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into two serving dishes to share.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>TO PREPARE BBQ</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the grill to medium heat and lightly grease the surface. Lay the pork belly strips, mushrooms, and garlic cloves on the grill and cook for approximately 2-3 minutes before flipping them over to the other side.</li>
            <li>After flipping, let the meat sear for 30 seconds before cutting the pork belly into bite-sized chunks with a pair of scissors. Continue cooking until the pork belly is golden brown and crispy, adjusting the heat if it browns too quickly.</li>
            <li>Avoid flipping the meat too often to prevent loss of flavor, and keep an eye on the mushrooms and garlic to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Use a paper towel to wipe away any excess oil as needed. Additionally, you can add kimchi to the grill and cook it in the pork fat for added flavor.</li>
            <li>To make a wrap, take a slice of lettuce and/or perilla leaf in one hand, dip a piece of cooked meat in sesame oil, add some ssamjang sauce, green onion salad, and fried garlic to it. You may also add fried kimchi on top if you prefer. Roll it tightly and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
