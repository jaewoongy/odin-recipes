        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>For the (Optional) Medium Boiled Eggs:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To medium boil the eggs, cover the eggs with a few inches of water and bring to a boil in a deep saucepan over high heat.  </li>
            <li>Once boiling, cook 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and place directly into an ice bath (a large bowl filled with cold water and ice). Allow to set in the ice bath for 2 minutes to stop cooking.</li>
            <li>To remove the peel, gently tap the bottom, flat end of the egg with a spoon, then carefully slide the spoon around the egg, in between the out layer of the egg and the inside of the peel to remove the entire peel.  Set aside.</li>
            <li>For the Brown Rice:</li>
            <li>In a deep pot, combine brown rice with low sodium chicken broth and sea salt and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook the rice at a low simmer for about 25 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. Then, set it aside to cool.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>For Korean Beef:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, add olive oil and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and cook until it’s well-browned, about 6-8 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef into small, even pieces.</li>
            <li>Then, add the minced garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until it’s fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, add coconut sugar, low sodium soy sauce, fresh minced ginger, orange zest, fresh orange juice, sesame oil and crushed red pepper flakes, and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add in the soy sauce mixture to the ground beef, and stir until well combined. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat through.</li>
            <li>Then, remove this from the heat, and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
            
        <h3>For the Carrot Salad:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add carrots, rice vinegar, raw honey, freshly grated ginger, low sodium soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Toss to coat.</li>
            <li>To Assemble Korean Beef Bowl Meal Prep:</li>
            <li>Start by adding our steamed brown rice to the meal prep container, followed by the Korean ground beef mixture, and then the fresh carrot salad and a few sliced cucumbers to fill out the rest of the container. Top with sliced green onion and a soft boiled egg.</li>
        </ol>
